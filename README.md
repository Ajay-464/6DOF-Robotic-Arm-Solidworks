# 6DOF-Robotic-Arm-Solidworks
This project presents a complete CAD design of a 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) industrial robotic arm, modeled in SolidWorks. The robotic arm is designed for precision tasks such as pick-and-place, welding, and CNC automation, providing a solid foundation for simulation, control, and future prototyping.

Key Features:

* Fully articulated 6 DOF arm structure
* Modular joint and link design for easy modification
* Industrial-grade appearance
* Designed for manufacturing and simulation purposes
* Assembly ready for motion analysis and FEA
* Grippers can be changed accordingly
